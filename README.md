# Demographic Change: Understanding Fertility Through Data

This project aims to analyze how environmental and societal factors affect fertility rates across different countries.  
It focuses on the relationship between **women’s labour force participation, modernization, urbanization, and fertility rates**, with the goal of generating insights and future predictions using data science and machine learning techniques.

## 🧠 Methods and Tools
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Prophet  
- **Models:** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor
