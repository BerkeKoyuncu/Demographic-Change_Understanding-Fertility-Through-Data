# Demographic Change: Understanding Fertility Through Data

This project aims to analyze how environmental and societal factors affect fertility rates across different countries.  
It focuses on the relationship between **women’s labour force participation, modernization, urbanization, and fertility rates**, with the goal of generating insights and future predictions using data science and machine learning techniques.

## Methods and Tools
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pathlib, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Prophet  
- **Models:** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor

## Data Sources
- [World Bank – Total fertility rate](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- [World Bank – Female labour force participation](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS)
